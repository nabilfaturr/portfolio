# Introduction

This is my first blog, i created it with Nextjs 14 and MDX.

## Why i created this blog

I created this blog to share my knowledge and experience with the community. I will be posting about my learning in web development, and i will be posting about my projects. if you have any questions, you can ask me in the contact section.

## Why i choose to build this blog with Nextjs 14 and MDX

I choose MDX because i want to use React in my blog, and i want to use Nextjs 14 because i want to try the new features.
It supports hot reloading, so i can see the changes i made immediately. and the best part is that i can use the same components in my blog that i use in my website.
